# My Personal Portfolio

I made this portfolio so that other people, mainly companies and recruiters, can learn more about me.

## About the Project
I created the project with vite to have a more optimized project, it is a react project with javascript, to style the project I used Tailwindcss along with pure CSS, in addition to other tools that integrate with tailwind such as daisyUI, postcss, autoprefixer and radix, and to create some nice animations I used framer motion and typed.js.
So far these are the technologies that have been used in this project.
